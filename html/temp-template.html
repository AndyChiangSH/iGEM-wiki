                    Since the impetus to quantify plant growth rate related to the efficiency of biostimulant, we
                    exploit relative growth rate (RGR) which mathematically could be written as: [2]

                    The initial and alternative mass of plants, M1 and M2 respectively, were set as primary indexes and

                    For <i>Oryza sativa</i>, the featured plant within our experiment, the RGR data were collected from
                    three independent replications for evaluating the theoretical relative growth changing pattern
                    (i.e., 0s indicated the relative distance between 0s' and CK's data point) and plotted in Figure 2
                    as Y-axis; the data points of testing experiments were collected from the other three independent
                    replications and plotted in Figure 2 as X-axis. The linear regression method was used for the
                    validation and evaluation of RGR biomass pattern between samples. The RGR biomass pattern regression
                    line of the prediction and our experiment is Y=0.2151X-0.0037 and R2 is 0.8756, which represent the
                    high fitness between our data and the theoretical model. The result simultaneously indicates that
                    the 0-fold and 100-fold diluting <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> RM125/PQQ supernatant inoculation (the
                    bacterial incubation were performed with saccharified straw liquid) can well improve on rice biomass
                    accumulation and both of them are quite better compared to CK. (Figure 2)

                    <P>We also test the three main indexes within RGR calculation, including unit leaf rate (ULR),
                        specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf mass fraction (LMF). Among these, a described factor Growth
                        response coefficient (GRC) was also considered while evaluating the improvement effect of our

                        The results indicate that the 0-fold and 100-fold diluting Bacillus subtilis RM125/PQQ
                        supernatant inoculation (the bacterial incubation were performed with saccharified straw liquid)
                        are the best condition of inoculants for Oryza sativa growth improvement. (Figure 4~7) Notably,
                        these modelling analysis results are highly matched to our follow-up in greenhouse experiments
                        (i.e., 0-fold and 100-fold diluting <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> RM125/PQQ supernatant inoculation
                        are also the best conditions for the plant's growth) and which are now already for harvest. (see

                        To us, the specific modified endophyte, RM125 can make plants growth promoting. We assume that
                        it and its products have ability to decrease the emission of CO2 from the planting period. Aim
                        to calculate the emission of CO2 concentration from plants and soil. The total CO2 output from
                        the soil is mainly from the respiration of living root and microorganic biota in soil.
                        Therefore, we divide it into two parts of content.
                        The part of soil can be described as:

                        under standard condition, V (m3) and A (m2) are the volume and bottom area of the chamber,
                        respectively, Δc (m3 m−3) is the change in CO2 concentration in the chamber during the period Δt
                        (h), T is the absolute temperature and α is the conversion factor for CO2 to C (12/44).

                        And the other is root respiration of the plant, we did 16 groups of inoculating the pellet of
                        RM125 (RM125/pel.), supernatant containing PQQ without bacteria (sup.) in kinds of dilution
                        ratio 100-fold, 200-fold and fertilizer (TFC.) in kinds of dilution ratio100-fold,250-fold,
                        500-fold and 1000-fold, which are treatments of planting and soil only. Put the same treatment
                        of plants, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, in self-designed airtight chamber for 40 minutes
                        accumulating CO2 to be detected respectively. Simultaneously, the data of plants’ dry weight
                        from three independent replications in different treatments had been collected. Evaluate
                        relative statement between the result of CO2 emission and biomass of plants.
