                <h2 id="item-1">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary goal of our project is to achieve circular agriculture by reuse of <i>Oryza sativa</i>
                    straws. Decomposing agricultural wastes accompanished by the <i>Oryza sativa</i> becomes the first
                    aim. To fulfill the aim, we transferred the cellulase genes into <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and
                    produced enzymes with scaffolding protein that could be assembled as a cellulosomal enzyme system to
                    degrade <i>Oryza sativa</i> straws.
                </p>
                <h2 id="item-2">Construction of Cellulosome</h2>
                <p>
                    On the gel electrophoresis diagram, the third well contains the plasmid of scaffolding protein gene
                    <i>cipA</i>. From seventh well to twelfth well, they respectively contain the plasmid of cellulase
                    gene <i>celA</i>, <i>celK</i>, <i>celR</i>, <i>celS</i>, <i>xynC</i> and <i>celZ</i> (Figure 1).
                </p>
                <p>

                    These cellulase can be classified into three groups. CelA and CelR are endo-glucosidases. CelK and
                    celS are exo-glucosidases. XynC and xynZ are both xylanase. In order to achieve the maximum
                    efficiency, the cellulase that have better activity in each group are chosen for the experiments,
                    the construction of our cellulosome containing XynC, CelK, CelA and scaffolding protein CipA.

                <p>
                    To quantify the sugar concentration in our broth, we mixed the DNS with the sugar that will change
                    color while reaching one hundred celsius degrees. After calibration and testing of the
                    OD<sub>600</sub> value, we obtained the concentration of the sugar in the <i>Oryza sativa</i> straw
                    by analyzing how much the sugar generates, and calculated the weight of sugar generated from
                    <i>Oryza sativa</i> straws by concentration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our cellulosome are assauredly viable because ensurement is made that our experimental environment
                    is sterile and only the cellulosome we put in can decompose the cellulose and hemicellulose (Figure
                    2).

                    The next step is to transfer the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) synthesis genes into the <i>Bacillus
                        subtilis</i>, which can make the <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> produce pyrroloquinoline quinone and
                    act as endophyte to accelerate <i>Oryza sativa</i> growth.

                    <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> WB800 with PQQ plasmid significantly improved stalk height, the stalk

                <p>
                    <i>Arabidopsis</i> inoculated with PQQ has the highest performance in the leaves area of
                    <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The
                    leaves area is about 5 cm², in contrast to 4 cm² of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> WB800, and to 3 cm² of
                    CK

                    In test on <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i>, we got the same result: <i>Bacillus
                        subtilis</i> RM125 inoculated with PQQ plasmid
                    can effectively improve plant growth, and the PQQ gene may be the key factor.

                    The persistence and effectiveness of the end product might be affected by the success of in planta
                    endosymbiotic <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> RM125/PQQ. Thus, we re-isolated the strain after inoculation
                    to check the endosymbiosis of the artificial endophyte, which may be the most intuitive way for the
                    evaluation. For the <i>Bacillus</i> species, selective medium and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing
                    checks were used; for PQQ biosynthesis genes, plasmid size, PQQ biosynthesis genes size, and the
                    follow-up Sanger-sequencing of these genes checks were performed (Figure 9 & 10). Taken all
                    together, our results directly indicate the success of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> RM125/PQQ in planta
                    endosymbiosis.

                    use the bacteria with the medium as a growth biostimulant to increase agricultural productivity. The

                    <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> RM125 with PQQ plasmid. We have <i>Oryza sativa</i> straw for carbon
                    sources and Okara for
                    nitrogen sources. After a series of experiments, we found that 1:4 is the best ratio of <i>Oryza
                        sativa</i> straw
                    to Okara(Figure 12). The OD600 value of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> RM125 with PQQ can achieve nearly

                    Supernatants of higher concentration seemed to be more effective (Picture 2 & 3 ). Treatment with 1x
                    and 1/100 x supernatant significantly increased the leaves number, shoot height, and leaf
                    length (Figure 14A,14D,14E).The tiller quantity of <i>Oryza sativa</i> inoculated 1x supernatant
                    escalated by
                    50.3%(Figure 14B) and the dry weight was doubled (Figure 14C). In the meantime, the tiller quantity
                    of <i>Oryza sativa</i> inoculated 1/100x supernatant was raised by 29%(Figure 14 B), the dry weight
                    was increased by
                    96%( Figure15C), and chlorophyll content raised 1.5 times (Figure 14F).

                    More tillers means the <i>Oryza sativa</i> may have more ears ,and the increase of chlorophyll

                    The vegetative phase of <i>Oryza sativa</i> is about two months, and about 3-5 seedlings will be
                    planted together
                    until the total amount of tiller reaches 20-25, then the <i>Oryza sativa</i> is ready to enter the
                    reproductive
                    phase. According to this, 4 tillers is the lowest value for every single plant. While the control
                    groups have about 4 tillers, inoculated <i>Oryza sativa</i>(1x,100x) have already reached 6-8
                    tillers,(Figure16B)
                    which means that inoculants shorten the time for <i>Oryza sativa</i> to reach 4 tillers, helping
                    <i>Oryza sativa</i> enter the
                    reproductive phase earlier. Water sources are becoming a serious problem in agriculture because of

                    To us, the specific modified endophyte, RM125 can make plants growth promoting. We assume that it
                    and its products have ability to decrease the emission of CO2 from the planting period. Aim to
                    calculate the emission of CO2 concentration from plants and soil. The total CO2 output from the soil
                    is mainly from the respiration of living root and microorganic biota in soil. Therefore, we divide
                    it into two parts of content.
                    The part of soil can be described as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    where F (mg C cm−2 h−1) is the soil respiration rate, ρ is the density of CO2 (1.98 × 103 g m−3)
                    under standard condition, V (m3) and A (m2) are the volume and bottom area of the chamber,
                    respectively, Δc (m3 m−3) is the change in CO2 concentration in the chamber during the period Δt
                    (h), T is the absolute temperature and α is the conversion factor for CO2 to C (12/44).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the other is root respiration of the plant, we did 16 groups of inoculating the pellet of RM125
                    (RM125/pel.), supernatant containing PQQ without bacteria (sup.) in kinds of dilution ratio
                    100-fold, 200-fold and fertilizer (TFC.) in kinds of dilution ratio100-fold,250-fold, 500-fold and
                    1000-fold, which are treatments of planting and soil only. Put the same treatment of plants,
                    <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, in self-designed airtight chamber for 40 minutes accumulating CO2 to be
                    detected respectively. Simultaneously, the data of plants’ dry weight from three independent
                    replications in different treatments had been collected. Evaluate relative statement between the
                    result of CO2 emission and biomass of plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depend on the result of experiment to the CO2 emission from plants and soil, which are effected by
                    multiple treatments, we utilized our modeling value, represent the part of soil respiration, been
                    reduced by emission of whole planting condition in chamber to obtain the respiration rate of plants
                    only. the analysis result shows that the treatments of fertilizer have higher in respiration rate
                    than the others in common. And the median of RM125/pel. is in middle of the distribution. The
                    sup/100X and sup/200X obviously emits lower CO2 than others except for water.

                    is 1/100 and 1/200.The darker the spot color, the higher the concentration. The yellow spot is
                    pellet treatment, inoculated the pellet of our artificial endophyte.CK is control group, treat with
                    pure water. The result show that supernatant and pellet treatment can reduce the emission of carbon
                    dioxide and also increase the biomass of <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
