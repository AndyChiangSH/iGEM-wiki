                                The problems of agricultural waste management is a worldwide issue. That is to say,
                                publicization of our concept is necessary, especially to the farmers.
                                First of all, in order to realize the local farmers’ viewpoint and difficulty about
                                agricultural waste management, we had an interview with them. Next, we featured a
                                podcast with PanSci and we shared not only iGEM but the issue that the farmers cared the
                                most was the cost. And last but not least, we would have an interview with the relevant
                                authority, Nantou Environmental Protection Bureau, to understand what the opinion of the

                                To accomplish the purpose of estimate PQQ's benefits of plants growth and promotion of
                                harvest, our modeling utilize two equations to calculate the predicted M_2 (unit:g) and
                                exact M_2 (unit:g), dry plant mass, which are employed to evaluate the relative
                                deviation between different inoculated concentration supernatants from the Bacillus
                                subtilis RM125/PQQ culture and water, and use population mean and perspective plant
                                data-1 to draw the linear regression pattern as the result, we have extremely excellent
                                decision coefficient <span class="math-formula">R^2=0.8756</span> which really can
                                explain the exact data and predicted
                                data.

                                Cellulolytic enzymes first decompose the rice straw to produce saccharification straw
                                liquid, which can incubate the Bacillus subtilis RM125/PQQ. It could produce valuable
                                biostimulants that can significantly foster rice growth. Through all the steps in this
                                system, nothing would be wasted , which can successfully verify that circular
                                agriculture is accomplishable.

                                In addressing the problem of agricultural waste disposal, it is also necessary to
                                understand the perspectives of farmers and the approaches authorities adopt and increase
                                public awareness of agricultural waste. Thus, we have come up with several ways to have
                                a communication with the authorities and the public about circular agriculture .
